                     <h2 id="desc">Collection Description</h2>Scope and Content NoteThe papers of Vincent Leonard Price, Jr., (1911-1993) span the
                     years 1883-1992, with the bulk of the items concentrated in the period 1932-1992.
                     They
                     document his life as an actor, art collector and critic, writer, lecturer, and gourmet
                     cook. The interconnectedness of his activities and interests is evident in this
                     collection. Price got his start as an actor on the London stage
                     while he was studying art history at the University of London.
                     Throughout his life, Price was a strong supporter of the arts and used his celebrity
                     as
                     an actor as a tool to bring art into people's lives. He used the money gained through
                     acting to buy art. He lent works from his art collection and donated many of them
                     to
                     galleries and museums. He served on arts councils and wrote on art and cooking. He
                     lectured on his life as an actor and on art. He narrated an academy award winning
                     film
                     on Chagall. He appeared as an art expert on the television quiz
                     show "The $64,000 Challenge" and hosted a cooking show. He exploited his fame as the
                     star of horror films to sell products ranging from credit cards to submarine sandwiches.
                     Although Price achieved fame by playing villains, early in his career he was considered
                     a matinee idol.Price's papers are arranged into six series: Family Papers; General Correspondence; Sears, Roebuck and Company
                     Files; Speeches and Writings Files; Stage, Screen and Studio
                     Files; and a Subject File.The Family Papers series, 1883-1992, consists of correspondence and other material
                     grouped under the names of family members. The correspondence is arranged
                     chronologically and consists primarily of letters received from members of
                     Vincent Price's family: his wives, actress Edith
                     Barrett, costume designer Mary Grant, and actress
                     Coral Browne; his son Vincent Barrett
                     ("Barrett"); his daughter Mary Victoria ("Toria");
                     his sisters Harriet Fenton ("Hat") and Laura Louise Gay
                     ("Lollie"), as well as other relatives. Also in this series are letters
                     from Vincent Price ("Bink") to his parents in the 1930s describing his European tour
                     with the Yale University Glee Club, his art studies at the
                     University of London, and his experiences in
                     Hollywood working on his first film.While correspondence relating to specific activities is filed by topic in the relevant
                     series, the General Correspondence series, 1938-1992, is arranged
                     in chronological order and documents Price's friendships and the wide variety of his
                     interests and activities. The major portion of this series consists of letters received,
                     although attached to much of the correspondence from the 1960s are copies of Price's
                     handwritten responses or the responses typed by his secretary, Wawona
                     Hartwig. This correspondence includes letters spanning fifty years from
                     friends such as college roommate Edmund Thomas ("Ted") and
                     Cecil Baldwin, whom he met while teaching at Riverdale
                     Country Day School; official letters requesting appearances or proposing
                     other activities; and mail from the public relating to his acting, writings, and art
                     expertise. Prominent correspondents include Letitia Baldrige,
                     Charles Collingwood, Joan Crawford,
                     Henry Dreyfuss, Deanna Durbin,
                     Alec Guinness, Helen Hayes, Sam
                     Jaffe, Roddy McDowell, Stanley
                     Marcus, Perry Rathbone, Joan
                     Rivers, and Mary Wickes.The Sears, Roebuck and Company series documents Price's activities as a consultant to this firm from 1962 to
                     1977. As part of his work with Sears, he formed Vincent
                     Price Enterprises along with Lester Salkow and
                     Harry Sundheim.Mary Grant Price was also active in Sears
                     ventures. The major focus of his work involved the Vincent Price Collection of
                     Fine Art which Price put together as original art for sale in
                     Sears stores. Price saw this venture as a part of his efforts to
                     bring art to people in their daily lives. As part of this project he travelled
                     throughout the world buying original works of art. Mary Grant Price
                     did the framing of the art work. Shows of selected pieces were sent to
                     Sears stores throughout the country at prices ranging from as
                     little as twenty-five dollars to ten thousand dollars. Vincent Price made personal
                     appearances at many of the art shows. Other activities he undertook for
                     Sears included the development of reproductions for a decorating
                     line called National Treasures and other merchandise such as a line of men's toiletries,
                     chocolates, and a Bible illustrated with the works of Michelangelo.
                     He also made public appearances and advertising commercials promoting various
                     Sears products and ventures. Correspondence with
                     Julius and Lessing J. Rosenwald, artists
                     such as Streeter Blair, Peter Hurd,
                     Harold Towne, and Andrew Wyeth, and with
                     the major figures involved in planning and administering these
                     Sears activities is also included.Price's writings on a wide range of subjects are contained in the Speeches and Writings Files, 1931-1991. His books include a popular cookbook
                     written with his wife, an autobiographical memoir of his experiences with art, a tribute
                     to his favorite dog, a book on American art, and a discussion of monsters written
                     with
                     his son. The books file contains original drafts, correspondence, research notes,
                     and
                     clippings, with the exception of I Like What I Know,
                     which does not contain a draft of the text. The articles file covers topics ranging
                     from
                     his acting career to art, travel, and cooking. Price also wrote forewords and
                     introductions to cookbooks, art books, and biographies. The columns file relates to
                     the
                     newspaper column on art which Price wrote from 1966 to 1970 for the Chicago
                     Tribune-New York News syndicate; it contains his drafts, notes, and
                     related correspondence. The poetry file contains poems Price wrote throughout his
                     life,
                     many jotted on scraps of paper, the back of script pages, and airplane boarding passes.
                     Poetry was a common form of expression for several generations of the Price family.
                     The
                     Family Papers series includes poems written by his father and his son. The
                     lectures and addresses file contains the texts of talks Price gave at specific events
                     as
                     well as various versions of the lectures he performed on tour.Encompassing many aspects of the entertainment business, the Stage, Screen, and Studio
                     Files, 1935-1992, chronicle Price's career as an actor and entertainer. Price
                     performed on the stage, in films, on radio, and on television. He served as narrator
                     in
                     live performances and in the studio. He made commercials for a variety of products
                     and
                     public service announcements for many organizations. He went on lecture tours and
                     made
                     numerous additional public appearances, serving as master of ceremonies at awards
                     functions and fashion shows, as art judge and auctioneer, as celebrity chef, and as
                     guest lecturer on cruises. He attended a great variety of functions. This series is
                     organized according to type of activity and is then arranged either alphabetically
                     by
                     title of project or chronologically. Files contain scripts, programs, correspondence,
                     clippings, and other documents.Included in the films section of this series are files on the majority of Price's
                     motion
                     pictures. Although Price was renowned for his roles in horror pictures, his film career
                     had many more dimensions. There are some gaps in coverage, primarily in films from
                     the
                     1940s, including Laura, Leave Her to Heaven, and Shock. Contained in the files, however,
                     are materials relating to his first movie, Service de Luxe; his films for American International
                     Pictures; Theatre of
                     Blood, the project in which he met and acted with his future wife,
                     Coral Browne; Vincent, in which he narrated a film short by Tim
                     Burton about a boy who idolized Vincent Price; and Disney's The Great Mouse Detective, in which he
                     provided the voice of the villain, Professor Ratigan.The lectures section of the Stage, Screen, and Studio Files provides a
                     chronological record of the presentations Price conducted several months each year,
                     such
                     as "Three American Voices," "Dear Theo", "The Enjoyment of Great Art," and "The Villains
                     Still Pursue Me." He lectured primarily at colleges, women's clubs, and in town lecture
                     series. As a lecturer he often attended dinners, visited art galleries, and met with
                     students. For a time he was the highest paid lecturer in the United
                     States.Price's extensive work in the theater, on the London stage, on
                     Broadway, and in summer stock is recorded in the plays section
                     of this series. The files primarily contain programs, correspondence, and clippings.
                     Included is Orson Welles'sMercury Theatre production of Shoemaker's Holiday. Price married his costar Edith
                     Barrett. There are extensive files on the musical, Darling of the Day, which played on
                     Broadway in 1968, and Diversions and Delights, the one-man play in which Price portrayed
                     Oscar Wilde from 1977 to 1982.The radio section covers much of Price's radio work, including appearances on programs
                     in the United States and England and on voice
                     tracks for Voice of America programs. Missing, however, are
                     materials from early dramatic broadcasts on which Price performed, such as "Escape,"
                     "Suspense," and "The Saint." Starting in the early days of the medium, Vincent Price made over a thousand appearances
                     on television in all types of programming. As the television section of this series
                     illustrates, he performed in dramas, situation comedies, variety shows, game shows,
                     talk
                     shows, and programs for children. He played serious roles as well as humorous
                     characterizations of his film persona on British as well as American television.
                     Documents contained in this section include his official statements regarding his
                     activities on "The $64,000 Challenge" made during the quiz show scandal investigations,
                     the transcript of Edward R. Murrow's interview with him in his
                     art-filled home for the "Person to Person" program, and the discussion topics for
                     his
                     many appearances on the NBC program "The Tonight Show" from the
                     1960s through the 1980s.The miscellaneous files section of the Stage, Screen, and Studio files
                     contains general material relating to Price's career as a performer. While publicity
                     relating to a specific project is filed with that project, the publicity file in this
                     section contains more general and personal publicity. Similarly, contracts and
                     correspondence from agents relating to a specific project are filed with that project,
                     but general material from agents is filed here under business materials. The Subject File, 1920-1992, is arranged alphabetically by topic and contains
                     files relating to Price's personal art collection and his involvement with various
                     organizations, museums, and academic institutions. There are files on the schools
                     he
                     attended in St. Louis and on Yale University
                     and the Courtauld Institute of Art at the University of
                     London. There are also files on his work to support and promote the art of
                     Native Americans. Price served on the Indian Arts and Crafts Board of the
                     Interior Department for over a decade and sponsored the Vincent Price
                     awards in creative writing through the Institute of American Indian
                     Arts. A few appointment books and calendars provide insight into his busy
                     life for the years covered. In addition, under the heading "Staff" are memoranda and
                     reports from office staff to Price to keep him apprised of news and activities relating
                     to his projects and schedule while he was filming, on art buying trips, or on lecture
                     tours.Organization of the PapersThe collection is arranged in seven series:Family Papers, 1883-1991General Correspondence, 1938-1992Sears, Roebuck and Company Files, 1943-1976Speeches and Writings Files, 1931-1991Stage, Screen, and Studio Files, 1935-1992Subject File, 1920-1992Oversize, 1938-1991.
