Macdonald (1845-1906), LL.B., M.D., was a Fellow of the New York Academy of Medicine and a prominent New York psychiatrist.  Born in Toronto, Dr. Macdonald was educated at the Toronto Model Grammar School and at Upper Canada College.  Although he began his medical studies at the University of Toronto, Dr. Macdonald moved to New York and ultimately received degrees in both medicine (M.D.) and law (LL. B.) from the University of the City of New York (now New York University) in 1870 and 1881, respectively.</p><p>Upon graduation from medical school, Dr. Macdonald was appointed assistant physician (and, later, resident physician) at the Hospital for Epileptics and Paralytics, Blackwell's Island, in 1870.  The next year he became chief of staff of the Charity and Allied Hospitals, Blackwell's Island.  In 1874, Dr. Macdonald began his long tenure at the New York City Asylum for the Insane, Ward's Island (later renamed the Manhattan State Hospital East), first as resident physician and then, from 1875 to 1904, as medical superintendent.  In 1886, Dr. Macdonald became general superintendent of the New York City Asylums.  This position brought with it responsibility for the administration not only of the New York City Asylum, Ward's Island (with its branches on Randall's Island and in Central Islip, Long Island), but also of the Reception Pavilion of the Insane, Bellevue and the New York City Lunatic Asylum, Blackwell's Island (with branches on Ward's and Hart's Island).</p><p>Notable achievements during Dr. Macdonald's career include his frequent consultation as an expert witness in important trials including the Guiteau, Rhinelander and Stokes cases as well as his work in the care of the tubercular insane, and the introduction of tent life for their treatment.  Dr. Macdonald published widely and was a member of a number of medical organizations including not only the New York Academy of Medicine but also the American Medical Association, the Medical Society of the State of New York, the Medical Society of the County of New York, and the New York Psychiatrical Society.  He was an honorary member of both the American Medico-Psychological Association (for which he served as President in 1904) and the British Medico-Psychological Association.  Dr. Macdonald was routinely sent as a delegate of these organizations to various congresses and association meetings.  In addition to his professional affiliations, Dr. Macdonald was a member of the Lotus Club and a Mason of Holland Lodge, New York City.</p><p>Over the course of his career, Dr. Macdonald held a number of academic posts.  In 1874, he was appointed lecturer on Medical Jurisprudence at New York University.  Subsequently, he became Professor of Psychological Medicine and Medical Jurisprudence, and was Emeritus Professor at NYU at the time of his death.</p><p>Alexander E. Macdonald was married to Elizabeth Woodbury Barrett (of Portland, Maine) on July 10, 1883.  Together they had two children -- a son, Charles, and a daughter, Evelyn.  Dr. Macdonald died on December 7, 1906.</p></div><!--  /bioghist  --><div class="bs-docs-section"><h2 id="desc">Collection Description</h2><h3 class="head-info" id="d1e61">Scope and Content</h3><p>The Alexander E.
